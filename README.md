# Bubbles

Just a tiny little application that will show a bubble sort in progress. Its real use will be a playground for, initially, _styled components_.

While not the focus of this exercise, I've used a bubble sort as I wanted to easily see its progress in operation, this is much easier with the bubble sort as it's iterative rather than making use of recursion like, say, _quicksort_.
